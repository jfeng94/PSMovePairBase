This application can simulate mouse movement and clicks under Linux (X11) and
Mac OS X.

See the source code for button mappings.

Requirements:

   - PS Move API built in "../../../build/" or installed system-wide
   - Linux only: libxdo-dev (www.semicomplete.com/blog/projects/xdotool/)

On Mac OS X, a custom xdo-compatible implementation will be used that utilizes
native OS X APIs to move the mouse cursor. You do not need libxdo on OS X.
