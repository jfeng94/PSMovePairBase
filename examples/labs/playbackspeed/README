This application expects that the PS Move API has been
build in "build/" in the root source folder.

After you have built the PS Move API in this way, you can
use "qmake" to generate a Makefile and then "make" to build
the application.

Additional requirements: Qt Mobility 1.2 (QtMultimediaKit)

To use this example, you have to place a file called "input.wav"
in the current working directory. This file will be played back,
and you can control the playback speed by placing your controller
on a turntable (45 RPM) and modifying its rotational speed.
