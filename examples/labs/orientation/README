This application expects that the PS Move API has been
build in "build/" in the root source folder.

After you have built the PS Move API in this way, you can
use "qmake" to generate a Makefile and then "make" to build
the application.

Additional requirements:

  This requires Qt 4.8.2 + Qt3D 1.0.
